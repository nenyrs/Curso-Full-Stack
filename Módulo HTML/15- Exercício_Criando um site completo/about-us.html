                        Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (doing business as SpaceX) is an American spacecraft manufacturer, space launch provider, and a satellite communications corporation headquartered in Hawthorne, California. SpaceX was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, with the goal of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars. SpaceX manufactures the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, several rocket engines, Cargo Dragon, crew spacecraft, and Starlink communications satellites.
                        <br><br>
                        SpaceX is developing a satellite internet constellation named Starlink to provide commercial internet service. In January 2020, the Starlink constellation became the largest satellite constellation ever launched, and as of May 2022 it comprises over 2,400 small satellites in orbit.[7] The company is also developing Starship, a privately funded, fully reusable, super heavy-lift launch system for interplanetary and orbital spaceflight. Starship is intended to become SpaceX's primary orbital vehicle once operational, supplanting the existing Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Dragon fleet. Starship will have the highest payload capacity of any orbital rocket ever built on its debut, scheduled for 2022 pending launch license.[8]
                        <br><br>
                        SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit around Earth,[9] the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft, the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station, the first vertical take-off and vertical propulsive landing for an orbital rocket booster, first reuse of such booster, and the first private company to send astronauts to orbit and to the International Space Station. SpaceX has flown and landed the Falcon 9 series of rockets over one hundred times.

                        2001–2004: Founding
                        In early 2001, Elon Musk donated a hundred thousand dollars to the Mars Society and joined its board of directors for a short time.[10]: 30–31  He was offered a plenary talk at their convention where he announced Mars Oasis[11], a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse and grow plants on Mars, to revive public interest in space exploration.[12] Musk initially attempted to acquire a Dnepr ICBM for the project through Russian contacts from Jim Cantrell.[13] However two months later, the United States withdrew from the ABM Treaty and created the Missile Defense Agency, increasing tensions with Russia and generating new strategic interest for rapid and re-usable launch capability similar to the DC-X.[14]
                        <br><br>
                        When Musk returned to Moscow with Mike Griffin (who led the CIA's venture capital arm In-Q-Tel[15]), they found the Russians increasingly unreceptive.[16][17] On the flight home Musk announced that he could start a company to build the affordable rockets they needed instead.[17] By applying vertical integration,[16] using cheap commercial off-the-shelf components when possible,[17] and adopting the modular approach of modern software engineering, Musk believed SpaceX could significantly cut launch price.[17] Mike Griffin would later be appointed NASA administrator[18] and award SpaceX a $396 million contract before SpaceX had ever flown a rocket.[19]
                        <br><br>
                        In early 2002, Musk started to look for staff for his new space company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached rocket engineer Tom Mueller (later SpaceX's CTO of propulsion) and invited him to become his business partner. Mueller agreed to work for Musk, and thus SpaceX was born.[20] SpaceX was first headquartered in a warehouse in El Segundo, California. Early SpaceX employees such as Tom Mueller (CTO), Gwynne Shotwell (COO) and Chris Thompson (VP of Operations) came from neighboring TRW and Boeing corporations following the cancellation of the Brilliant Pebbles program.[21] By November 2005, the company had 160 employees.[22] Musk personally interviewed and approved all of SpaceX's early employees.[23] Musk has stated that one of his goals with SpaceX is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of access to space, ultimately by a factor of ten.
