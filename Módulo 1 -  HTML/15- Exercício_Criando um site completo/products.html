            <p>
                In April 2007 the USAF approved the use of Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) by SpaceX.[183] The site has been used from 2010 for Falcon 9 launches, mainly to low Earth and geostationary orbits. SLC-40 is not capable of supporting Falcon Heavy launches. As part of SpaceX's booster reusability program, the former Launch Complex 13 at Cape Canaveral, now renamed Landing Zone 1, has since 2015 been designated for use for Falcon 9 first-stage booster landings.

                On 14 April 2014, SpaceX signed a 20-year lease for Launch Complex 39A.[187] The pad was subsequently modified to support Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches. SpaceX launched its first crewed mission to the ISS from Launch Pad 39A on 30 May 2020.[188] Pad 39A has been prepared since 2019 to eventually accommodate Starship launches. With delays in launch FAA permits for Boca Chica, the 39A Starship preparation was accelerated in 2022.

            <p>
                SpaceX manufactures and flies Starship test vehicles from a facility at Boca Chica, Texas, with future plans to conduct orbital Starship flights in 2021.[190] SpaceX first publicly announced plans for a launch facility near Brownsville, Texas in August 2014.[191][192] The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued the permit in July 2014.[193] SpaceX broke ground on the new launch facility in 2014 with construction ramping up in the latter half of 2015,[194] with the first suborbital launches from the facility in 2019.[175] Some residents of Boca Chica Village, Brownsville, and environmental activists criticized the site along with Starship development program in various aspects.

            <p>
                In January 2015 SpaceX announced it would be entering the satellite production business and global satellite internet business. The first satellite facility is a 30,000 sq ft (2,800 m2) office building located in Redmond, Washington. As of January 2017, a second facility in Redmond was acquired with 40,625 sq ft (3,774.2 m2) and has become a research and development laboratory for the satellites.[197] In July 2016, SpaceX acquired an additional 8,000 sq ft (740 m2) creative space in Irvine, California (Orange County) to focus on satellite communications.
